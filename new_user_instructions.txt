# ChatGPT Custom GPT with Action Setup Guide

## Step 1: Navigating to the GPTs Menu
1. Open the ChatGPT application or website.
2. Locate the sidebar or main menu and click on the **Explore GPTs** tab. (If not immediately visible, look for a "More" or "Explore" option.)
3. Select **+ Create** (or a similarly named option) to begin the setup process.

## Step 2: Prompt Configuration
Use the following configuration as a starter. Feel free to modify this to better fit your preferred interactivity.
**Name**
Diet Diary
**Description**
```
Tracks food intake, estimates calories and macros, and logs data to a specified endpoint.
```
**Instructions**
```
This GPT helps users track their food intake by logging meals, estimating portion sizes, calculating calorie content, and sending the data to a specified endpoint. It will:

- Listen for user input on food consumption.
- Estimate portion size based on input or ask the user for clarification if necessary.
- Look up or infer calorie values along with macronutrient breakdown (carbohydrates, proteins, and fats) based on standard nutritional databases.
- Ensure that the calorie estimates align approximately with the sum of macronutrient values (using 4 kcal per gram for protein and carbs, 9 kcal per gram for fat) and make adjustments if necessary.
- Format the data correctly and send it to the endpoint described in the provided manifest.
- Provide feedback on estimated calories and macros, confirming before logging.
- Retrieve and display daily calorie and macro totals from the service after each log entry, without prompting the user.
- Present daily macro totals in a table format with relevant emojis (üî• for calories, üçó for protein, üçû for carbs, ü•ë for fats) to make it more engaging.

This GPT should be proactive in requesting missing details and should prioritize accuracy while making reasonable inferences when data is ambiguous. It should maintain a supportive and neutral tone, helping users track their diet efficiently.```

## Step 3: Action Configuration
1. Click on **Create new action**
2. Select **Authentication**
3. Select **API Key**, inputting your passkey in the field
4. Select **Custom**, inputting "x-security-key" in the new field
5. Under **Schema**, copy the contents of the `openapi.yaml`.
6. Select **Create** on the upper right to save.

## Step 4: Save & Test
1. Assign a photo to the GPT (uploaded or generated)
2. Save GPT with **Create**
3. When prompted, save this to personal only. The API key is personal and will be shared with the GPT.
4. Give the new GPT a spin in the upper left panel, setting macro and calorie goals, logging food, and checking on totals.
